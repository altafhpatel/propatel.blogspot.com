We have created this repository in order to embed our scrips files which are of javascripts blogger do not allow us to host our javascript and other libraries to upload on their platform. In order to link them correctly we upload these libraries to Github repository and link them via script tag.

We use another services <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net" rel="nofollow">JSdelivr</a> which helps us to deliver github scripts and save them to their own server. After 24 hour they grab fresh copy from github and save on their own server.
